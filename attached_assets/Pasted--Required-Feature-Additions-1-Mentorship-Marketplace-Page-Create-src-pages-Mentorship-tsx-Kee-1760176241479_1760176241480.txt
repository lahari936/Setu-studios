🧩 Required Feature Additions
1️⃣ Mentorship Marketplace Page

Create /src/pages/Mentorship.tsx

Keep existing navbar, footer, and theme consistent.

Display mentor cards (photo, name, domain, expertise, “Connect” button).

On clicking Connect, open the existing enquiry form component (reuse from site).

Use local data (mentors.json or static array) — no backend changes.

2️⃣ Blog Page

Create /src/pages/Blog.tsx

Two sections:

Startup Stories — static Markdown or hardcoded sample posts.

Startup News — fetch dynamically using https://newsapi.org/ (6 latest startup articles).

Responsive grid layout, matching site style.

3️⃣ AI Analyser Enhancement

In the AI Idea Analyser page/component:

Add a “Execute with Us” button below the generated report.

On click → open existing enquiry form.

Add Download Report (PDF) button → use html2pdf.js to export report section.

4️⃣ AI Co-Founder Assistant (Chatbot)

Add a chatbot icon (bottom-right) that stays visible on all pages.

Opens a small popup chat window titled AI Co-Founder Assistant.

Integrate a basic LLM API (like HuggingFace or OpenAssistant) for text suggestions.

Minimal, non-intrusive design matching theme.

Fully frontend-side implementation.

5️⃣ Homepage (Optional)

Add small navigation links or CTAs to new features (Mentorship, Blog, AI Assistant).

Do not change hero section, fonts, or colors — just link buttons subtly.

🔒 Rules

Do not alter any backend or API endpoints.

Do not modify or remove existing frontend elements or pages.

Do all work locally in your cloned repo, then push to
👉 https://github.com/lahari396/Setu-studios

Test with npm run dev before every push.
